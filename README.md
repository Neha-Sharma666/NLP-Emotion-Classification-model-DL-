Emotion Classification Model-->
Introduction to Emotion Classification:
Emotion classification is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and categorizing emotions expressed in text. Emotions play a pivotal role in human communication, influencing decisions, behaviors, and interactions. Understanding these emotions through computational models can provide valuable insights across various domains such as customer service, marketing, social media analytics, and mental health.

Overview of Project:
The emotion classification model developed in this project is designed to analyze Hindi text and classify it into predefined emotion categories. This model leverages advanced machine learning techniques, combining the strengths of IndicBERT for generating rich text embeddings and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for emotion prediction

Importance of model:
The importance of this model can be highlighted in several ways:
1.	Language-Specific: Tailored for Hindi, leveraging IndicBERT's understanding of Indian languages.
2.	Emotion Detection: Enables systems to understand and respond to human emotions, enhancing user interaction.
3.	Transfer Learning: Utilizes pre-trained models to achieve high performance with less training data.
4.	Custom Architecture: Combines state-of-the-art embeddings with a flexible MLP classifier for improved accuracy.
5.	Scalable and Adaptable: The architecture can be adapted for other languages and emotion categories with minimal adjustments.

Key Components of the Model-

   1.IndicBERT Embeddings:
•	IndicBERT Model: A pre-trained transformer-based model specifically designed for Indian languages, including Hindi. It captures contextual information, making it highly effective for understanding nuances in the text.
•	Embedding Extraction: Extract embeddings from the second last layer of IndicBERT to utilize the semantic information encoded in the text.

   2.MLP Classifier:
•	Architecture: The MLP classifier consists of multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. It is designed to process the embeddings and output emotion predictions.
•	Regularization Techniques: Incorporate dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Library used:
- Hugging face transformer: for indicbert model, tokenization 
- pytorch: torch.nn , torch.optim for training MLP classifier, optimization, loss fn.
- sklearn: for data splitting, label encoding, model evaluation
